🎵 Bringing Music to Life with Python and Hand Gestures! 🎶

🤖 Ever imagined controlling your music playlist with just the wave of your hand? 🌟 With the power of Python and computer vision, I've created a mesmerizing project that allows you to play and control your favorite tunes using hand gestures. 🎵🖐️

🎥 I harnessed the capabilities of OpenCV and a Hand Tracking Module to detect and interpret hand movements captured through your device's camera. This ingenious code recognizes various hand gestures, making your music experience truly magical.

👉 Here's a quick rundown of what the code does:

✋ Raise all fingers to pause/play the music.
🤘 Raise two fingers to groove to the beats of "Mood."
✌️ Three fingers up and you'll be vibing to "Señorita."
🖖 Four fingers up, and "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran fills the air.
🖐️ Raise all five fingers to enjoy the sounds of "STAY."
🤟 The ultimate hand gesture (all five fingers plus a thumb) treats you to "Dance Monkey."
🕒 Seamless timing between gestures and music playback ensures a smooth and immersive experience. A dash of web automation magic with PyAutoGUI and webbrowser modules ensures that your music journey flows uninterrupted.
